v1.2
 - i should be crucified i think
 - let's just not talk about this okay
 - license file changed to a .txt because duh web development
 - which wow can i just say, mit is such a cool license.
 - also there's now a link to the changelog in the app. hello!

v1.1
 - removed text in med-kit selector, added alt text. too lazy to add alt text to everything but I'll get there.
 - selections are now highlighted. please don't open the javascript it's genuinely dreadful.
 - the none perk option has been renamed to "remove selection" which feels somewhat more accurate.
 - oh and i combined the brown and green medkits cuz. yeah. gotta work on the images.
 - might remove the calc reset since it was a bandaid for the no selection bg thing but it's nice
 - mit license link is now destylized. is that what you'd call it? idk, it looks nice okay.
 - removed some old irrelevant stuff from the javascript. this is to compensate for me shoving approximately 257 pipe cleaners into it
